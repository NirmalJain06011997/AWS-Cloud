# Creating Multiple Directories in Linux

> **mkdir {1..50}**
	- Using this command we can create multiple directories in the linux operating system.
	- This command makes directories with the names as '1','2','3' and so on till '50'.

> **mkdir day{1..50}**
	- If we simply add any name before the braces in the command then this name will be added before the number eg: 'day1','day2','day3' and so on till 'day50'.
